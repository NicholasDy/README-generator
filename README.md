#  Readme-Generator-for-Professional-Use

## Project Name - Readme-Generator-for-Professional-Use

### User Story - I am looking to create a professional readme for each of my projects without having to create a lot of the formating. 

### Description of the App - 
The app takes user input through the node.js program and creates a fully functioning readme with active links to each of the different sections in the readme's. Using github badges there are going to badges at the top of each of the Readme's that will show which of the license's that the user chose from. 


### Video -
Please refer to the videos in the assests file for the walkthrough of the full project.
